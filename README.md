# Player-Owned Ports calculator

This a Played-Owned Ports calculator for the [Alt-1 toolkit](https://runeapps.org/alt1).

## Installation

**It will not read the data from the _Crew Roster_ interface**, this feature will hopefully be added soon.

To get started, simply put your mouse over a crew member and press the Alt + 1 key combination. The reader will find the data on the screen and automatically fill it in the corresponding box on the plugin interface.

### Missing crew types

While the app is in development, many crew types will be missing. When the reader cannot find the proper crew type, it will display a popup like this :

Click on the textarea to automatically select the text, copy it and send it to Popoplo0 on Discord.

The message will only be displayed one per unknown type.
